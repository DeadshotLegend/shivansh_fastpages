### Duck DNS
- Sign up for a DuckDNS account by visiting https://www.duckdns.org/ and selecting "Create Account."
- Once you have created an account, you will be prompted to create a subdomain. Enter a unique name for your subdomain, and then click the "Add Domain" button.
- Next, you will need to download the DuckDNS client to keep your IP address updated. You can find the client at https://www.duckdns.org/install.jsp. Choose the appropriate client for your operating system.
- Once you have downloaded the client, extract the files and run the installation script.
- After installation, you will be prompted to enter your DuckDNS subdomain and token. You can find your token by logging into your DuckDNS account and clicking the "Install" tab.
- Start the DuckDNS client, and it will automatically update your IP address every time it changes. You can confirm that the client is working by checking the "Logs" tab in your DuckDNS account.
- Finally, you can use your DuckDNS subdomain to access your home network from the internet. To do this, you will need to configure your router to forward incoming requests to your local IP address.
